# Update in v1.0.1

- Maintain the compatibility with HiView, which has improved significantly after the original DDOT publication
- A new script (`tohiview.py`) and a [tutorial](https://github.com/fanzheng10/ddot/blob/master/examples/1.0.1_HiView_tutorial/hiview_tutorial.ipynb) of uploading to HiView server has been added
- Running [CliXO 0.3](https://github.com/mhk7/clixo_0.3), [CliXO 1.0](https://github.com/fanzheng10/CliXO-1.0) and [alignOntology](https://github.com/mhk7/alignOntology) from DDOT is not longer supported (in order to make this package lighter and more "Pythonic"). Please visit the original repositories of these programs.
- We only tested new content with Python >=3.6, as Python 2 has been declared obsoleted.

New dependencies:

- [ndex2-client](https://pypi.org/project/ndex2/)

# The Data-Driven Ontology Toolkit (DDOT)

The Data-Driven Ontology Toolkit (DDOT) facilitates the inference, analysis, and visualization of biological hierarchies using a data structure called an ontology.

- Open-source Python package under MIT license. Supports Python 2.7 or >=3.6.
- The [HiView](http://hiview.ucsd.edu) web application visualizes hierarchical structure and the biological evidence for that structure.

# Documentation

For a quick start on DDOT's functionality, please see the [tutorial](examples/Tutorial.ipynb) and other Jupyter notebooks in the [examples](examples) folder.

For further documentation, please see http://ddot.readthedocs.io/. This includes a description of the [Ontology class](http://ddot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ontology.html) and a list of [utility functions](http://ddot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html).

Please post questions or issues to the [Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ontology).

# Installation

DDOT requires the following software

- Python v2.7 or >=3.6
- [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
- [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
- [pandas>=0.24](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [networkx>2.0](https://networkx.github.io/).
- [python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/). Recommend installing through [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-igraph) or [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-igraph/0.7).
- [ndex-dev](https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-python). Recommend installing through [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ndex-dev).
- [tulip-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tulip-python). Recommend installing through [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tulip-python).


The recommended method for installing these dependencies is to use the [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) distrubution of Python, and then install Python packages via the conda and pip repositories.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional, but recommended).
# Learn more about virtual environments at https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
conda create -n <environment_name>
source activate <environment_name>

# Install dependencies
conda install -y pandas numpy scipy networkx>=2.0
conda install -y -c conda-forge python-igraph
conda install -y libiconv # Needed for igraph to run properly
pip install tulip-python
pip install ndex-dev
```

### Install the `ddot` Python package

After dependencies are satisfied, download or clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[Host_username]/ddot.git
```

Install ddot using `pip`. If you are installing within a conda virtual environment, remember to enter the environment with `source activate <environment_name>` before running `pip`.

```bash
pip install /path/to/ddot_repository
```

### Known installation problems and tips

- Older versions of Anaconda (<= v4.5) might not install the dependencies correctly. Consider updating Anaconda to the newest version by running `conda update conda` (outside of a virtual environment).
- Make sure that no other local installations of Python is conflicting with Anaconda. In particular, check that the directory `$HOME/.local/lib` does not contain Python packages. If it does contain Python packages, check that those packages are not being imported.
- If `ddot` does not import successfully in a Python terminal, first check that the dependencies can be imported. In particular, check that `import ndex, networkx, igraph, tulip, numpy, scipy, pandas` works.
- Please raise any other installation problems as an issue on this github repo.

# Docker image (v1.0)

A Docker image of DDOT is located online at Docker Hub. To learn more about Docker, see https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

### Download and run image from Docker Hub

For Python 3.6,

```bash
# Download image installed with DDOT in anaconda3 (Python 3.6)
docker pull michaelkyu/ddot-anaconda3
# Run image in a container
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 michaelkyu/ddot-anaconda3
```

For Python 2.7,

```
# Download image installed with DDOT in anaconda2 (Python 2.7)
docker pull michaelkyu/ddot-anaconda2
# Run image in a container
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 michaelkyu/ddot-anaconda2
```

### Using DDOT in Docker

After running the image, you will be inside the container's command line. Here, you can run DDOT in a basic Python terminal

```
(base) root@<container>:/$ python

Python 2.7.14 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Dec  7 2017, 17:05:42)
[GCC 7.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ddot
```

Alternatively, you can run DDOT in [example Jupyter notebooks](examples). To do so, start a Jupyter server in the container's command line

```
(base) root@<container>:/$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --allow-root --ip 0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=''
```

Next, open up your web browser and access the notebooks at http://0.0.0.0:8888/. We recommend starting with the tutorial `Tutorial.ipynb`.
